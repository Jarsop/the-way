# The Way
A code snippets manager for your terminal.

Record and retrieve snippets you use every day, or once in a blue moon,
without having to spin up a browser. Just call `the-way new` to add a snippet with a 
description, a language, and some tags attached. `the-way search` fuzzy 
searches your snippets library (with optional filters on language and tags) and 
lets you copy a particular snippet to your clipboard, so you can paste 
it into whatever editor or IDE you're working with.

See it in action (with some self-referential examples):

## Features
### Main features
* Add and edit code snippets
* Interactive fuzzy search
* Filter by tag, date, and/or language
* Copies selected snippet to clipboard
* Import / export via JSON

### Sync to Gist (new from v0.5.0!)
`the-way sync` syncs snippets to a Gist, each named `snippet_<index>.<extension`, with an `index.md` file linking each snippet's description. 
Local updates and deletions are uploaded to the Gist and Gist updates are downloaded.

![gist](gist.png)

This functionality needs a [GitHub access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the "gist" scope. 
Either enter this token on running `sync` for the first time or set it to the environment variable `$THE_WAY_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Shell completions
```bash
the-way complete zsh > .oh-my-zsh/completions/_the-way
exec zsh
```

### Syntax highlighting
The Way maps languages to their extensions and uses this to
1. Enable syntax highlighting in `$EDITOR` (if the editor supports it),
2. Upload snippets to Gist with the correct extension,
3. Add a small colored language indicator (GitHub-flavored)
4. Syntax highlight code in the terminal
The last point can be customized via `the-way themes`. 

Use `the-way themes set <theme>` to enable a theme.

**Default themes:**
```
Darcula
InspiredGitHub
Solarized (dark)
Solarized (light)
base16-eighties.dark
base16-mocha.dark
base16-ocean.dark
base16-ocean.light
base16-tomorrow.dark
base16-twilight.dark
```

Use `the-way themes add <theme.tmTheme>` to add a new theme to your themes folder.
Theme files need to be in Sublime's [.tmTheme](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/color_schemes_tmtheme.html) format. 
Searching GitHub for [.tmTheme](https://github.com/search?q=.tmTheme) pulls up some examples. 

`the-way themes list` shows all available themes.

### Configuration
The default config TOML file is located in
* Linux: `/home/<username>/.config`
* Mac: `/Users/<username>/Library/Preferences`

This file contains locations of data directories, which are automatically created and set according to XDG and Standard Directories guidelines.
Change this by creating a config file with `the-way config default > config.toml` and then setting the environment variable `$THE_WAY_CONFIG` to point to this file.

## Why "The Way"?
The name is a reference to [the Way of Mrs.Cosmopilite](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/The_Way_of_Mrs._Cosmopilite), k≈çans for every situation.
