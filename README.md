# The Way (`the-way`)
A code snippets manager for your terminal.

Easily record and retrieve snippets you use every day, or once in a blue moon,
without having to spin up a browser. Just call `the-way` to add a snippet with a 
description, a language, a source, and some tags attached. `the-way search` fuzzy 
searches your snippets library (with optional filters on language and tags). 
And `the-way copy` lets you copy a particular snippet to your clipboard, so you can paste 
it into whatever editor or IDE you're working with.
