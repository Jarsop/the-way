# The Way (`the-way`)
A code snippets manager for your terminal.

Record and retrieve snippets you use every day, or once in a blue moon,
without having to spin up a browser. Just call `the-way` to add a snippet with a 
description, a language, and some tags attached. `the-way search` fuzzy 
searches your snippets library (with optional filters on language and tags) and 
lets you copy a particular snippet to your clipboard, so you can paste 
it into whatever editor or IDE you're working with.

See it in action (with some self-referential examples):
